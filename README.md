# Focused Writing Timer

A minimalist web app to help you focus on writing for a set period of time. The app encourages continuous writing by fading out your text if you stop typing for too long.

## Features
- Select a writing session duration (1, 3, or 5 minutes)
- Progress bar shows remaining time
- If you stop typing, your text fades out and disappears, pausing the timer
- Download your writing as a Markdown file
- Copy your writing to the clipboard
- Start a new session easily

## How It Works
1. Select a session duration using the timer buttons.
2. Click **Start** to begin writing.
3. If you stop typing for a moment, your text will begin to fade out. If it disappears, the timer pauses until you start typing again.
4. When the timer ends, you can download or copy your writing, or start a new session.
